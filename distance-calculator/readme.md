  <summary>Preface</summary>

```
-When you ride 60 kmh, you travel 17m in 1 second, but at 80 kmh it's *counting...* it's 22m. Just imagine how much you'll travel at 120 looking at a deer, for example, for 2 seconds?
-How much?
-*counting...* Can you create a table?
-Yep, how much columns and rows? ... Well, I can give this opportunity to you ;)
